# Coding Assessment

## Description

This application is a quiz that consists of several JavaScript questions to assess the user's knowledge.  The landing page gives some instructions on how to begin and start a timer when the user begins.  It will show if a user selects the correct or incorrect answer and update the score as the user presses next.  If an incorrect answer is selected, 10 seconds is removed from the timer.  Finally, the user's score is stored locally as well as logged in the console.  I am still working on getting the high scores section to display.

## Usage
